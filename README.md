# mmoEconomyFHE: A GameFi MMO with an FHE-encrypted Player-Driven Economy ðŸŽ®ðŸ’°

mmoEconomyFHE is an innovative massively multiplayer online game (MMO) that leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology** to create a player-driven economy. This captivating GameFi experience allows players to influence the economic systemsâ€”such as resource outputs and price indicesâ€”dynamically and homomorphically based on their collective actions. Immerse yourself in a living economic environment that evolves unpredictably, offering players a truly unique and engaging gameplay experience.

## The Pain Point: Unpredictable and Manipulated Economies

Many traditional multiplayer online games suffer from fixed, predictable economies controlled by developers. This leads to a lack of authenticity in player interactions and a disconnection from real-world economics. Players often feel that their choices and strategies have little or no impact, leading to disillusionment and reduced engagement in the game.

## Enter FHE: The Revolutionary Solution

**Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** transforms this paradigm by allowing sensitive economic data to remain encrypted while still being processed and analyzed. Implemented using Zama's open-source libraries such as **Concrete**, **TFHE-rs**, and the **zama-fhe SDK**, it enables a new layer of privacy and security in economic interactions. Players can engage fully in the game without worrying about their personal information or actions being exposed, and their collective behaviors directly shape the dynamic economy in real-time. This ensures that the economic landscape evolves based on genuine player input rather than developer manipulation.

## Core Functionalities: Key Features of mmoEconomyFHE

- **FHE-Encryped Economic Parameters**: All core economic metrics are encrypted, ensuring confidentiality and security.
- **Homomorphic Impact**: Player actions dynamically and homomorphically influence the game economy, fostering a responsive and lively virtual market.
- **Truly Player-Driven Economy**: Create and manage your in-game wealth without interference from game studios, resulting in a vibrant, emergent economy.
- **Sandbox Environment**: Explore, play, and strategize in a sandbox setting where every choice has consequences.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE Libraries**: Core functionalities built upon **Concrete**, **TFHE-rs**, and **zama-fhe SDK**.
- **Programming Languages**: Solidity for smart contracts, JavaScript for game logic.
- **Frameworks & Tools**: Node.js for backend operations, Hardhat for Ethereum development, and Web3.js for blockchain interactions.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or above)
- **Hardhat** (for Ethereum development)

### Setup

1. **Download the project files** and navigate to the project's root directory.
2. In your terminal, run the following command to install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command will fetch all necessary libraries, including Zama's FHE libraries, to set up your development environment.

## Build & Run the Project

Follow these steps to compile and run the project:

1. **Compile the smart contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run the tests** to ensure everything is functioning correctly:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the contracts** to a local blockchain network:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

## Example Usage

Here's a quick example of how to interact with the economic system in `index.js`:

```javascript
const { Economy } = require('./economy');

// Initialize economy
const economy = new Economy();

// Simulate a player action affecting the economy
economy.simulatePlayerAction({
    playerId: 'Player1',
    actionType: 'trade',
    tradeAmount: 100
});

// Output the new state of the economy
console.log('New Economic State:', economy.getCurrentState());
```
